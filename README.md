3D game developed in Unity.


Ways to develop the project:
- More complex levels.
- More complex shapes of the ground objects.
- 2nd mode: billards.
- 3rd mode: drawing a shapes in the air to make ball collide with them.
- Soundtrack.
- MongoDB database of levels and profiles.
- 4th mode: server play. Levels for multiple users or maybe PvP mode.
- New levels related to collision with water.
- Add documentation, especially in github repository.
